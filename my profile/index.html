			<h2>Bass and guitar</h2>
				<p>I've been playing bass and guitar for three years and that's my main hobby.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="h22">
			<H2>Reading</H2>
				<p>I always loved reading but for the past few years I really got into fantasy and I love it!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="h22">
			<h2>Metal music</h2>
				<p>Metal music has been a part of my life for five years and it's still my favourite musical genre by far.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="h22">
			<h2>Chess</h2>
				<p>I got into chess last year and I've fallen in love with it! I'm currently rated 1350 elo, which isn't that bad in my opinion :)</p>
